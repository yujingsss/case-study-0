            <p>This project is telling a cinematic story about memories in an abandoned place like a memory palace. This
                virtual environment will contain many abandoned objects in an underwater environment by imagining the
                space in a futuristic setting and convey the ideas by its narrative way, characters, style, and audio.

            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <li>An abandoned place with futuristic concept and aesthetic style</li>
            <li>Memory and consciousness</li>
            <li>Cinematic narrative</li>
            <li>Cyborg as main character</li>
            <h3>Project Mandate & Interactions</h3>
            <li>Consciousness and memory as solid existence</li>
            <li>Amplify the importance of memories for human beings, consider how memory is one of the most essential
                elements for a human being</li>
            <li>The participant is acted as a cyborg which trigger the consideration between artificial intelligence and
                humans</li>
            <li>In a futuristic setting, discover the relationship between human and artificial intelligence in which
                memories are a very crucial part of one's spirit (consider cyberpunk films settings like Blade Runner,
                Ghost In The Shell, West World)</li>
            <li>Interactions are built according to the objects which are picked when a participant encounters an object
                attached with memory, the scene will alter to a pure white scene (indicate the scene is preserved in
                memory)</li>
            <li>The giant robot is also the reflection of the character, like the god's eye observing the whole world
                like things that we cannot control</li>
            <li>Use particles and audio sources as guide</li>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to convey the ideas related to consciousness and memories through a
                cinematic narrative. Viewers within the virtual space granted the ability to walking around, exploring,
                and find those objects attached with memories in a visible way that would otherwise be unavailable in
                reality when just recalling traces of unclear memories. Additionally, the spatial aspects and the
                interactions contribute to the narrative in a more influential way to trigger the emotional impact on
                the participants.</p>
